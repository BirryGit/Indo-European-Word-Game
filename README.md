# Indo-European-Word-Game
It is a game about guessing the English counterpart to an Indo-European word in the fewest guesses possible. With each guess, the translation gets closer. It was inspired by Metazooa. This was a quick project I made for school. I am looking at adding more words and refining the gameplay.
